# Processing Projects

Part of a collection of projects made through Processing in Java!

## Asteroids Game

A project largely based on an arcade classic, [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))! Here is the [main program](/asteroids/asteroids.pde), which acts as the skeleton of whole game. 

##### The code is spread out by mode and game objects, including:

|                 Modes                  |             Game Objects             |
|             -------------              |           -------------              |
| [Intro](/asteroids/intro.pde)          | [Enemy Ships](asteroids/UFO.pde)     |
| [Game Play](/asteroids/game.pde)       | [Asteroids](asteroids/asteroid.pde)  |
| [Pause](/asteroids/pause.pde)          | [Bullets](asteroids/bullet.pde)      |
| [End of Game](/asteroids/gameover.pde) | [Ship](asteroids/ship.pde)           |
| and [more](/asteroids)!                | and [more](/asteroids)!              |
